# gradeques
You are tasked with creating a simple student grading program using Python. The program should take input from the user for the marks obtained by a student in a subject and then calculate and display the grade based on the following grading scale:

90 or above: A+

80 to 89: A

70 to 79: B

60 to 69: C

50 to 59: D

Below 50: Fail

Requirements:

Use control statements (if-elif-else) to determine the grade based on the marks obtained by the student.

Handle any potential errors in the user input (e.g., invalid marks) and display appropriate messages to the user.

Implement a loop to allow the user to calculate the grade for multiple students until they decide to exit.

Display the calculated grade for each student.
